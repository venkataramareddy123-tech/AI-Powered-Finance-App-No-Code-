# 💸 AI Finance App (No-Code Prototype using Lovable + ChatGPT)

This is a **work-in-progress** personal finance app prototype developed using **Lovable** (a no-code app builder) with the support of **ChatGPT** for design, logic, and prompts.

The app aims to **help users make smarter financial decisions** by using AI to analyze spending habits, automate regular expenses, and optimize budgets — all without writing traditional code.

## 🚧 Status: In Progress

While the app’s front-end and back-end have been mostly completed, there are **minor issues and unfinished logic in the backend** that are currently being debugged.

The main focus at this stage is showcasing:
- The concept
- User experience (UX)
- Visual design
- Prompt-engineered logic
- AI integration for financial decision-making
