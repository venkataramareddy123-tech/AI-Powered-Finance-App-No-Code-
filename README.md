#  AI Finance App (No-Code Prototype using Lovable + ChatGPT)

This is a **work-in-progress** personal finance app prototype developed using **Lovable** (a no-code app builder) with the support of **ChatGPT** for design, logic, and prompts.

The app aims to **help users make smarter financial decisions** by using AI to analyze spending habits, automate regular expenses, and optimize budgets â€” all without writing traditional code.

##  Status: In Progress

While the appâ€™s front-end and back-end have been mostly completed, there are **minor issues and unfinished logic in the backend** that are currently being debugged.

The main focus at this stage is showcasing:
- The concept
- User experience (UX)
- Visual design
- Prompt-engineered logic
- AI integration for financial decision-making

##  Key Features (Planned and Prototyped)

-  Expense tracking with category breakdown
-  AI-powered financial insights and saving suggestions
-  Smart reminders for bill payments
-  Dark mode toggle for modern UI/UX
-  Daily, weekly, and monthly budget analytics
-  Firebase backend integration via Lovable
-  Clean, responsive UI designed using prompt-based styling

## ðŸŽ“ What I Learned

- How to design and build full-stack apps using **no-code platforms**
- Creating clean, modern UI with the help of **AI**
- Structuring **backend workflows** without traditional coding
- Debugging no-code logic systems using prompt feedback loops

---

##  Next Steps

- Finalize backend logic (resolve minor bugs)
- Polish the UI with animations and transitions
-  Connect real-time AI suggestions to user data
- Add visual charts using no-code data visualization
